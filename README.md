# Burstiness and Memory in GitHub Activity Data


[Choosing distribution to model interevent times](work/figures/picking-dist.png)

GitHub is now the leading online platform for open source software development. For public
projects, all activity related to the project is publicly available, including when contributions are
made, when team members are added, and when general users interact with the repository. In this
study, we build off of the work of Klug and Bagrow [here](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.160007) by utilizing GitHub activity data to analyze whether people
work in a bursty manner. We present the results of analyzing more than 150,000 teams, looking not
only at whether teams exhibit burstiness, but also whether burstiness is correlated with success.
This gives insights into ways to structure teams so that success can be maximized.

This study was conducted by myself with support from Professor James Bagrow as a capstone project for the Data Science II course at the University of Vermont in the Spring of 2020.
